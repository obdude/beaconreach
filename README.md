### 🧩 How It Works: The "Source → Enrich → Act" Flow

Beaconreach works in three simple steps:

<div align="center">
  <p>
    <strong>1️⃣ SOURCE</strong><br>
    <em>Tell Beaconreach where to find people to connect with.</em><br>
    (e.g., a list of contacts, a social media platform, or a CRM)
  </p>
  <p>▼</p>
  <p>
    <strong>2️⃣ ENRICH</strong><br>
    <em>Gather more information about each person.</em><br>
    (e.g., find their email address, social media profiles, or website)
  </p>
  <p>▼</p>
  <p>
    <strong>3️⃣ ACT</strong><br>
    <em>Reach out to them in a personal and meaningful way.</em><br>
    (e.g., send a personalized email, connect on social media, or add them to your CRM)
  </p>
</div>
