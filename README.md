### ⚡ Build high-performance outreach pipelines. 100% Code. 0% Credit Markup.

**BeaconReach** is the open standard for GTM Engineering. It replaces expensive, black-box SaaS tools with a transparent, local-first automation layer.

---

### 🛑 The Problem: The "Growth Tax"
Modern GTM tools (like Clay, Apollo, etc.) are incredible, but they trap you in **Vendor Lock-in** and **Credit-Based Pricing**. 
- You pay a **10x-50x markup** on data enrichment (API calls).
- Your business logic is locked inside a proprietary UI.
- When you stop paying, your "brain" disappears.

### 💡 The Solution: Open Infrastructure
BeaconReach is **"Headless GTM"**. It decouples your logic from the data provider.

1.  **Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK):** Connect directly to OpenAI, Perplexity, Google, or Clearbit. Pay cost price. No middleman markup.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code:** Version control your outreach strategies. Treat your GTM pipeline like software, not a messy Zapier web.
3.  **Data Sovereignty:** Your contact graph lives in local JSON/CSV. You own the data layer.

### 🆚 The Stack Comparison

| Feature | Proprietary SaaS | BeaconReach (Open Source) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Logic** | Locked in UI / "Click-Ops" | Open Python / Standardized Config |
| **Enrichment Cost** | High Markup ("Credits") | **Cost Price** (Direct API) |
| **Data Ownership** | Rented (Disappears on churn) | **100% Owned** (Local / Git) |
| **Extensibility** | Limited to native integrations | Infinite (It's just code) |

### 🚀 Getting Started

BeaconReach is designed for two types of users:

#### 1. The Operator Path (No-Code)
*For founders, growth marketers, and non-technical teams.*
Run structured, high-value campaigns using our **Smart Spreadsheets** and **Markdown Templates**. No Python required.
👉 **[Read the Beginner Guide](docs/beginner_guide.md)**

#### 2. The Engineer Path (Code)
*For GTM Engineers, Clay Power Users, and Ops.*
Deploy the Python `core_engine` to orchestrate data enrichment, generate dynamic messaging, and manage your contact graph programmatically.
👉 **[Read the Advanced Docs](docs/advanced_guide.md)**

### 🧠 The Philosophy: "Zen of Outreach"
We believe outreach should be high-signal and value-first. Spam is a failure of engineering.
> *See [BEACONREACH.md](BEACONREACH.md) for the full protocol.*

1.  **Value First:** Every interaction must deliver a standalone asset or insight.
2.  **Schema over Chaos:** Relationships are data. Structure them.
3.  **Automate the Process, Not the Human:** Use code to gather context, use humans to verify empathy.
