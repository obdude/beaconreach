# The Zen of BeaconReach

**Protocol Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Open Standard

1.  **Value First.** Every interaction must deliver a standalone asset or insight. If the email is lost, the recipient should still be richer for having read it.
2.  **Assets over Asks.** Don't ask for time. Give a resource.
3.  **Schema over Chaos.** Relationships are data. Structure them (JSON/CSV) so they survive the tool du jour.
4.  **Ownership is Liberty.** Never build your core business logic inside a "Black Box" SaaS.
5.  **Context is King.** A generic message is spam. A contextual message is a service.
6.  **Low Frequency, High Signal.** One great message beats ten nudges.
7.  **Automate the Process, Not the Human.** Use code to gather data, use humans to verify empathy.
8.  **Open Source Forever.** The best GTM stacks are composable, transparent, and free from rent-seeking.
